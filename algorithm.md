Goal- The main goal of this program is to practice number of aspects of object-oriented programming, specifically the construction of an abstract data type, inheritance from an abstract class or interface, and data persistence through object serialization. The goal is to practice the above mentioned aspects by creating a virtual pet.

Input- In this program we will be takeing several inputs from the user regarding their pet, virtual pet will take the .ser file as input or the console as input. The various print functions will take whichever string/int they are going to print as an input (same for the modifier fuctions as well).

Output- The main output will be the inputs that we took from the user in a certain order. The main will call the functions as an output, virtual pet will also output .ser file, the print functions and the modifier functions will output whatever string or int they took as an input or data they took to modify. 

Steps- Main will call the functions, virtualpet will either output existing data from the .ser or gather data for it, print function will print the values, modifiers functions will modify the values, and savepet will save the gathered data in a .ser file.
