# What is this Project?
This Java project simulates a virtual pet, enabling users to create, customize, and save their pet's details like name, type, age, and favorite food through console interactions. It features serialization for persisting pet data across sessions and includes functionalities to modify pet attributes and celebrate its birthday. The project structure encompasses a `virtualpet.java` file, a makefile for build management, and a manifest for JAR execution, demonstrating basic object-oriented programming, file I/O, and user input handling in Java.
